Trying to write German on an English keyboard proves to be hard.
Entering umlauts like ä and ß is not easy.

This program will take insert umlauts in your clipboard.
You can copy your text, run this program, then paste your German text.

Replacements done by this program:

	Ae  - Ä
	ae  - ä
	Oe  - Ö
	oe  - ö
	Ue  - Ü
	ue  - ü
	sss - ß

Note that you need 3 s for ß. While it is natural to write ae, oe and ue,
it is usually ss that is being replaced with ß. But ss is also valid in
German so if we replace all ss with ß that would be wrong. Hence this
quirk.
